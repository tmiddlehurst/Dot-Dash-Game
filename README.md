# DOT-DASH Game


## Synopsis

DOT-DASH is a local multiplayer browser game.
It is a timed game based in a grid of 'tiles'. Two players race to reach score 'tiles' and ultimately get the highest score.
The winner is the player with the highest score once time expires.

## Motivation

DOT-DASH was created as a project to test and improve my skills in HTML, CSS/SASS and Javascript.
The game was created in four days using HTML, CSS/SASS and Javascript/JQuery.
